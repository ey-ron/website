      "Just a software developer with a passion for catching up with the latest technology, proposing solutions and identifying risks that may affect project delivery",
    description: [
      `I've been into computer since I was a kid. I started loving the machine through playing games, it made me discover that there is so much you can do and achieve through a computer.`,
      `I took up IT for College and it opened up a new dimension. I was amazed at how cool programming is.`,
      `I started working at Accenture as a software developer focusing in COBOL programming language. Eventually, I started to work in different teams using several technologies like Java, .NET, Unix, etc. It didn't take me long before I started to propose solutions to most problems that our project haven't explored. I've been working on ideas and turned them into proof-of-concepts.`,
      `At some point, I felt that something was missing. I was frustrated at how technology evolves like a speed of light and I felt like I am unable to keep up. It made me realise that I am looking for more challenge and started working on passion projects that involves modern programming languages. I started coding Python, Solidity for Blockchain Smart Contracts, ReactJS, Bootstrap, CSS, Unity as well for game development.`,
      `In my free time, I usually read things about the universe. I am a fan of the heavenly bodies from a very young age, and I still do. I dream of being an Astronaut, but haven't had the opportunity yet. Who knows, may be in the near future?`,
      `Oh! And I do play Airsoft as a hobby. It makes me feel super awesome, especially when I hit tons of enemies >_<`
