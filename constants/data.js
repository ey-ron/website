    description: [
      `I've been into computer since I was a kid. I started loving the machine because of games, and suddenly realized that there are so much to do and can achieve in a computer.`,
      `I took IT as course in College and it introduced me to another dimension. I am amazed about how cool programming is.`,
      `I started working in Accenture as a software developer focusing in COBOL programming language. Eventually, I started to work in different teams using several technologies like Java, .NET, Unix, etc. It didn't take too long before I started to propose solutions to most problems that our instituion haven't explored, I've been working on ideas and soon after are the proof-of-concepts.`,
      `As time goes by, I felt that something is missing. I am jealous on how technology improves like a speed of light and me not being able to understand. It opened up my heart that I am looking for more challenge and I started working on passion projects that involves modern programming languages. I started coding Python, Solidity for Blockchain Smart Contracts, ReactJS, Bootstrap, CSS, Unity as well for game development.`,
      `I do play Airsoft as a hobby. It makes me feel super awesome, specially if you hit so many enemies :D`
